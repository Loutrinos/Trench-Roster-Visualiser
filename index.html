If it begins its Activation Down and the above conditions are true, it must stand and then Charge, unless it cannot stand. If it begins its Activation in melee combat, it ignores this ability",

The Hunter must be touching a piece of terrain when it uses this power. When it does, it is immediately placed in contact with any other piece of terrain on the battlefield, including on top of or inside terrain, if legal positions exist. Its movement then continues as normal. All usual movement rules persist for this movement (moving into or out of Melee Combat, for example). The Hunter can do this multiple times during its chosen move, though it has to pay the BLOOD MARKER cost for each such jump between terrain pieces. If the Hunter uses this ability during a Charge, it does not need to take the most direct route possible toward its target, but it still selects its target as normal (i.e. it can see the target when declaring a Charge).",

Effects from the triggering event, such as BLAST weapons that originally targeted the Hunter, still affect other models as normal.",

            "ab_absolutefaith": "Sniper Priests do not use their eyesight to aim at their enemies. The opponent cannot apply any BLOOD MARKERs when they use a Ranged weapon. They still suffer penalties for Range and Cover as standard.",

            "ab_blessingoftheserpentmoon": "GOETIC (2-6) power: Before an injury roll is made against the Sorcerer, you may use this Goetic power to deduct one from that injury roll per two BLOOD MARKERS used.",
            "ab_swarmingattack": "When the Pit Locust makes a melee attack, it can make an additional attack with its stinger if it charged during this Activation. Pit Locusts suffer no penalties for fighting unarmed, nor do they suffer penalties or restrictions for making Off-Hand Attacks with their stingers. The first attack made by a Pit Locust has the Keyword SHRAPNEL and therefore causes an additional BLOOD MARKER. ",

            "ab_fortify": "During their Activation, an Engineer can take a RISKY ACTION with +1 DICE. If successful, the engineer is considered to be in Cover until the model moves. This ACTION cannot be used if the model is in Melee combat.",
